This is a collection of fish scripts and utilities that I've created mainly for in-house use.

**todo**

A fish script wrapper to the Trello CLI Ruby Gem (https://github.com/weavenet/trello_cli), which allows for easier todo list functionality from the command line. A configuration file with Board and List IDs must be specified in order for this script to work. It is an alpha state, and needs bug-fixes and more thorough testing
